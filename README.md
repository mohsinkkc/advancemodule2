1) Write the code, one line for each action:
Ans.
a. Create an empty object user.
const user = {};
This code declares a new constant called "user" and assigns an empty object to it using
curly braces {}. You can now add properties and methods to this object as needed.
b) Add the property name with the value John.
user.name = "John";
This code uses dot notation to add a new property called "name" to the "user" object
and sets its value to "John". Now the "user" object has a property called "name" with
the value of "John".
c) Add the property surname with the value Smith.
user.surname = "Smith";
This code uses dot notation to add a new property called "surname" to the "user"
object and sets its value to "Smith". Now the "user" object has two properties: "name"
with the value of "John" and "surname" with the value of "Smith".
d) Change the value of the name to Pete.
user.name = "Pete";
This code uses dot notation to access the "name" property of the "user" object and sets
its value to "Pete". Now the "user" object has two properties: "name" with the value of
"Pete" and "surname" with the value of "Smith".

e) Remove the property name from the object.
delete user.name;
This code uses the delete keyword to remove the "name" property from the "user" object. Now
the "user" object has only one property: "surname" with the value of "Smith".

2) Is array copied? let fruits = ["Apples", "Pear", "Orange"]; // push a new value into the
"copy" let shoppingCart = fruits; shoppingCart.push("Banana"); // what's in fruits?
Ans.

alert(fruits.length);In the given code snippet, the variable shoppingCart is assigned a
reference to the same array that fruits is pointing to. Therefore, when a new value "Banana"
is pushed into shoppingCart, it will also be added to fruits.
<script>

let fruits = ["Apples", "Pear", "Orange"];
let shoppingCart = fruits;
shoppingCart.push("Banana");
console.log(fruits);
</script>

3) Map to names let john = { name: "John", age: 25 }; let pete = { name: "Pete", age: 30 };
let mary = { name: "Mary", age: 28 }; let users = [ john, pete, mary ]; let names = /* ... your
code */ alert( names ); // John, Pete, Mary
Ans.

<script>
let john = { name: "John", age: 25 };
let pete = { name: "Pete", age: 30 };
let mary = { name: "Mary", age: 28 };
let users = [john, pete, mary];
let names = users.map(function(user) {
return user.name;
});
alert(names); // output: John, Pete, Mary
</script>

This code declares three objects john, pete, and mary with a name and age property. It
also declares an array called users and assigns the three objects to it.
The map method is called on the users array with a callback function that takes each
object user as input and returns the value of its name property. The map method then
creates a new array names with these returned values.
Finally, the alert method is used to display the names array, which contains the names
"John", "Pete", and "Mary".

4) Sum the properties There is a salaries object with arbitrary number of salaries. Write
the function sumSalaries(salaries) that returns the sum of all salaries using Object.values
and the for..of loop.If salaries is empty, then the result must be 0. let salaries = {
"John": 100,

"Pete": 300,
"Mary": 250 }; alert( sumSalaries(salaries) ); // 650
Ans.

In this implementation, the sumSalaries function takes an object salaries as its parameter.
It initializes a variable sum to 0, then uses a for...of loop to iterate over the values in the
salaries object (using the Object.values method), adding each salary to the sum variable.
Finally, it returns the total sum.
The code then creates an object salaries with three key-value pairs, representing the salaries
of three people. It passes this object as an argument to the sumSalaries function, and
displays the result of the function (the sum of the salaries) using the alert function. If the
salaries object were empty, the function would return 0.

<script>
function sumSalaries(salaries) {
let sum = 0;
for (let salary of Object.values(salaries)) {
sum += salary;
}
return sum;
}
let salaries = {
"John": 100,
"Pete": 300,
"Mary": 250
};
alert(sumSalaries(salaries)); // 650

</script>

5). Destructuring assignment We have an object: Write the Destructuring assignment that
reads: a) Name property into the variable name. b) Yearâ€™s property into the variable age.
c) isAdmin property into the variable isAdmin (false, if no such property) d) let user = {
name: "John", years: 30};
Ans.

<script>
let user = {
name: "John",
years: 30
};

let { name, years: age, isAdmin = false } = user;

console.log(name); // "John"
console.log(age); // 30
console.log(isAdmin); // false
</script>

6). Turn the object into JSON and back Turn the user into JSON and then read it back
into another variable. user = { name: "John Smith", age: 35};
Ans.

<script>
let user = {
name: "John Smith",
age: 35
};

// Convert the object to JSON format
let userJson = JSON.stringify(user);

// Parse the JSON string back into a new object
let newUser = JSON.parse(userJson);

console.log(user); // { name: "John Smith", age: 35 }
console.log(userJson); // {"name":"John Smith","age":35}
console.log(newUser); // { name: "John Smith", age: 35 }
</script>
